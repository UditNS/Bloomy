- 22. Encrypting Passwords

-- Flow of the api request
1. Validate the request data from the client
2. Encrypt the password
3. Create a new instance of the user model

- created a utils folder which has a validation.js file
- validation.js file checks for input validation
- Now to encryt the password we will be using a package named bcrypt
- used bcrypt.hash to encrypt the password
- improved the code as we never have to trust req.body
- Added login route which let user to login
- for login -> used bcrypt.compare to compare the password
- check for email and password

-- Understood why we should not write that email is incorrect and password is incorrect.
-- Because these error message is disclosing important information -> This is known as information leaking
-- Suppose if an attacker try to hack your webpage then why it will tell him this email is present or this is not present
